            A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
            these sweet <br />
            mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone,
            and feel the charm <br />
            of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls
            like mine. I am so <br />
            happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere
            tranquil existence, <br />
            that I neglect my talents. When, while the lovely valley teems with
            vapour around me, <br />
            and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
            follage of my <br />
            trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary.
